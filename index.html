        <h2>Roblox Experience</h2>
        <h3>Pokemon Brick Bronze</h3> 
        <p><i>2017 - until it got copyright striked</i></p>
        <p>Leveraged self-control to dedicate 6 hours running around grass in hopes of catching an event pokemon.</p>
        <p>Attempted to trade for shinies at a discount to generate alpha.</p>
        <h3>Tower of Hell</h3> 
        <p><i>Covid start - Covid end</i></p>
        <p>Exhibited self-initiative by studiously observing TOH YTers to get better.</p>
        <p>Beat a couple of towers and flexed on the server.</p>
        <h3>Natural Disaster Survival</h3>
        <p><i>2017 - whenever I last played</i></p>

        <h2>Fav Roblox Event: Egg Hunt</h2>
        <h3>The Great Yolktales</h3> 
        <p><i>2018</i></p>
        <p>By far the best egg hunt I ever did</p>
        <p>Also the last real egg hunt</p>
        <p>Got me so obsessed I even dreamt about it</p>
        <p>Many stressful, but rewarding, hours spent here</p>
        <h3>Scrambled in Time</h3> 
        <p><i>2019</i></p>
        <p>2018 had set such a high bar, it made 2019's new format feel even worse</p>
        <p>No longer were the egg hunts centralized in one game, but now split into many others</p>
        <p>Little did I know the 2018 egg hunt format would never occur again</p>
        <h3>Agents of E.G.G.</h3>
        <p><i>2020</i></p>
        <p>Similar to 2019. I was disappointed but hoped for better next year</p>
        <p>I had no idea this was going to be the last egg hunt.</p>
        <h3>Metaverse Champions</h3>
        <p><i>2021</i></p>
        <p>They replaced the egg hunt with this >:&#40;</p>
        <p>Spent hours grinding those boxes to unlock the very last egg ...</p>
        <p>... the Tiny Egg of Nonexistence</p>
        <p>&#40;Roblox even added a mini temple to honour all the egg hunts over the years&#41;</p>
